Start guide for UVa wifi connection (Wahoo) for Intel Edison board

First, start from putty, which you can download from http://www.putty.org/. 
After Installing it, in the following interface, firstly select connection type: “Serial”, 
and then put in Serial port: COM10, (at least for this board) and speed: 115200, and hit “Open”.

Then another interface shows up, and type “root”, and maybe your password, here my password is “EdisonEdison”.
Then you are allowed to go into the serial communication session, 
and type the command “configure_edison --wifi”, hit “Enter”.

And then you would see the list of the available network SSID options, 
what you need to do next is to enter the number corresponding to one of the listed network SSIDs, 
and maybe type in the password for encrypted network, then the connection is initiated. 
After you see “Done”, the connection is established. 

As is instructed, you can open the browser, and go to the link showed above or what you see in your own IDE. 
If the following message shows up, this means the connectivity is totally done. 

If the browser hangs, use the following command:
ifconfig usb0 down
ifconfig wlan0 down
ifconfig usb0 up
ifconfig wlan0 up
